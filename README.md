## Rationale

I have been using a Dell Precision T3500 Since 2009. First this was a workstation I used while working at Kodak,
then later using it at home, where I hadded a Sans Digital 8 bay RAID system for archival. This system also hosts
my two printers, an HP LaserJest 1018 and a Kodak Hero 9.1. I cannot get these to run on modern MacOS and Windows
systems, but there is some home TrueNAS may have support for the HP printer. The Kodak printer is quite the beast,
and is increasingly unreliable, so that will be a write-off.

After all this time, it is still running Windows 10, where I cannot upgrade to Windows 11. Also, when rebooting,
I have to manually intervene because the system battery is low, which has become troublesome, and worrying.

After watching a lot of YouTube videos, and doing other research, I was sold on the 45 Drives products because so
many people testified to the quality. Initially I thought I would go with the HL15, but considered the
[45drives.com](https://45drives.com) AV15 with AMD motherboard. However, this turned out to be too pricy for my tastes,
especially for cusomization. Also, the Storinator people really dropped the ball on presales support.

Going back to [45homelab.com](https://45homelab.com) I decided to just build it myself, and the presales support has
been much better.

### Supermicro H13SSL-NT

While I looked at a lot of differnt system boards, ultimately I decided I wanted at server board, and it had to be an
ATX form factor for the HL15. I also decided to go with the latest AMD Epyc technology, starting with a low end 9015.
If I decided I want more power, I can always upgrade the CPU.

The H13SSL-NT has 12 DIMM slots, but I will only use 4 DIMMs to start with, and upgrade later when I have the money.

The H13SSL-NT has two M.2 slots, and I decided to go with the WD Black SN850X with 8 TB so the wear leveling has the
most chance to preserve reliable storage, while also being high performance. I may find some Optane memory for the
second M.2 for ZFS write log if I feel I need better write performance.

The H13SSL-NT uses MCIO connectors for SATA, but unfortunately, 45 Drive do not stock cables for this.

While the H13SSL-NT supports remote management, I decided to get a JetKVM just in case... In particular, for first
configuration, you need to get in to the console to configure the remote management first. Also, if for any reason
the remote management is not working, the KVM is the most basic way to manage the server board.

### Software

My plan is to use TrueNAS and ZFS because my primary use will be as a media server, using Plex running under Docker.
Also, I will be serving both Apple File Service and Windows File Service (samba).

As a seasoned computer scientist and software engineer, who started programming in 1970, I like to do what I call
'recreational programming.' Now that I am retired, I would like to continue to play with technology, but not in a
mission critical way. TrueNAS has recently given up on Kubernetes, relying on Docker instead, and this makes me happy,
as there is little I find 'recreational' about Kubernetes.

### ZFS

One of the nicest new features of TrueNAS Electric Eel is that you can now add drives to a ZFS vdev, one drive at
a time, and the system will resilver it over time. This means I can start with fewer than 15 drives, and add more
when I need more storage.
